This is a multi-threaded CPU miner for Litecoin and Bitcoin,
fork of Jeff Garzik's reference cpuminer.

License: GPLv2.  See COPYING for details.

Downloads:  https://sourceforge.net/projects/cpuminer/files/
Git tree:   https://github.com/pooler/cpuminer

Dependencies:
	libcurl			http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/
	jansson			http://www.digip.org/jansson/
		(jansson is included in-tree)

Basic *nix build instructions:
	./autogen.sh	# only needed if building from git repo
	./nomacro.pl	# only needed if building on Mac OS X
	./configure CFLAGS="-O3"
	make

Notes for AIX users:
	* To build a 64-bit binary, export OBJECT_MODE=64
	* GNU-style long options are not supported, but are accessible
	  via configuration file

Detailed Windows build instructions, using MinGW (32-bit):
	Install MinGW and the MSYS Developer Tool Kit (http://www.mingw.org/)
		* Choose C, C++ and MSys on install as select to have it update its libraries
		* Install into C:\MinGW
	Include mstcpip.h from WINE in your MinGW library
		* http://source.winehq.org/source/include/mstcpip.h
		* select version 1.3.34
		* copy this code into C:\MinGW\Include\mstcpip.h (strip out the line numbers!)
	Install libcurl devel (http://curl.haxx.se/download.html)
		* download curl-7.30.0.tar.gz from http://curl.haxx.se/download.html and put it in C:\deps\
		* launch an MSYS shell and enter the following commands (the configure step will take a long time!)
			cd /c/deps
			tar -xvzf curl-7.30.0.tar.gz
			cd curl-7.30.0
			./configure –prefix=/c/mingw
			make
			make install
		* copy c:\deps\curl-7.30.0\docs\libcurl\libcurl.m4 c:\mingw\share\aclocal
		* copy c:\deps\curl-7.30.0\curl-config c:\mingw\bin
	In the MSYS shell, navigate to the CPUminer source code direcctory
		* You will likely get higher hashrates by forcing the compiler to build the executable for your 
		  specific CPU architecture.  This is done by adding "-march=<value>" into the CFLAGS.  Those
		  values can be found at http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/i386-and-x86_002d64-Options.html
		  	common choices for intel are : core2, corei7, corei7-avx
		  	common choices for AMD are : athlon-fx
		* Execute the following (replacing the value of -march with the value for your CPU type)
			./autogen.sh
			./configure CFLAGS="-march=core2 -O3"
			make
			strip minerd.exe
	Combine the executables with the dependencies
		* copy minerd.exe, C:\MinGW\bin\libcurl-4.dll, and C:\MinGW\bin\pthreadGC2.dll to the same directory

Detailed Windows build instructions, using MinGW (64-bit):
	Install MinGW and the MSYS Developer Tool Kit (http://www.mingw.org/)
		* Choose C, C++ and MSys on install and select to have it update its libraries
		* Install into C:\MinGW
		* Add C:\MinGW\bin and c:\MinGW\msys\1.0 to your path
	Download MinGW64 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Automated%20Builds/
		* Choose mingw-w64-bin_i686-mingw_20111220.zip
		* Extract ZIP to C:\MinGW64
		* Add C:\MinGW64\bin to your path before C:\MinGW\bin
	Install libcurl devel (http://curl.haxx.se/download.html)
		* download curl-7.30.0.tar.gz from http://curl.haxx.se/download.html and put it in C:\deps\
		* launch an MSYS shell and enter the following commands (the configure step will take a long time!)
			cd /c/deps
			tar -xvzf curl-7.30.0.tar.gz
			cd curl-7.30.0
			./configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 –-prefix=/c/mingw64
			make
			make install
			cp /c/deps/curl-7.30.0/docs/libcurl/libcurl.m4 /c/mingw/share/aclocal/libcurl.m4
	Install pthreads
		* download pthreads-20100604.zip from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/External%20binary%20packages%20%28Win64%20hosted%29/pthreads/ and put it in C:\deps\
		* unzip the file to c:\deps\
		* In the mingw64 subdirectory is pthreads-w64.zip - extract the contents to C:\MinGW64
	In the MSYS shell, navigate to the CPUminer source code direcctory
		* You will likely get higher hashrates by forcing the compiler to build the executable for your 
		  specific CPU architecture.  This is done by adding "-march=<value>" into the CFLAGS.  Those

			./autogen.sh
			./configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 CFLAGS="-O3 -msse4"
			make
	Strip minerd.exe
		* In a command prompt, in the compilation directory, execute the following
			x86_64-w64-mingw32-strip minerd.exe
	Combine the executables with the dependencies
		* copy minerd.exe, C:\MinGW64\bin\libcurl-4.dll, and C:\MinGW64\bin\pthreadGC2-w64.dll to the same directory

Usage instructions:  Run "minerd --help" to see options.

Connecting through a proxy:  Use the --proxy option.
To use a SOCKS proxy, add a socks4:// or socks5:// prefix to the proxy string.
If no protocol is specified, the proxy is assumed to be a HTTP proxy.
When the --proxy option is not used, the program honors the http_proxy
environment variable.  In this case, however, libcurl 7.21.7 or newer is
needed to handle protocol prefixes.

Also many issues and FAQs are covered in the forum thread
dedicated to this program,
